# Exercise 3 - Print Fibonacci Sequence

**Task Description:**

Use a loop to print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence to the console. Each number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

**Objective:**

This exercise aims to strengthen your understanding of loops in JavaScript by applying them to generate a well-known numerical sequence.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
0
1
1
2
3
5
8
13
21
34
```

**Instructions:**

1. Use a for loop to generate and print the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.
2. Initialize the first two numbers outside of the loop (0 and 1).
3. In each iteration, calculate the next number by summing the two preceding numbers and update the values accordingly.
