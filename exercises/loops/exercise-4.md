# Exercise 4 - Find Maximum Value

**Task Description:**

Write a loop that iterates through an array of numbers and identifies the maximum value in the array. Print the maximum value to the console once identified.

**Objective:**

This exercise is designed to reinforce your understanding of loop mechanics in JavaScript, specifically focusing on iterating through arrays to perform calculations.

**Example Array and Output:**

```plaintext
Array: [15, 22, 8, 34, 7, 78, 50]
Output: The maximum value is: 78
```

**Instructions:**

1. Use a for loop to traverse the array [15, 22, 8, 34, 7, 78, 50].
2. Maintain a variable to store the maximum value found during the loop.
3. Compare each array element with the current maximum value and update it if a larger number is found.
4. After completing the loop, print the maximum value to the console.
