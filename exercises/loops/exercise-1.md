# Exercise 1 - Odd Numbers While Loop

**Task Description:**

Write a while loop that iterates from -10 to 10. During each iteration, check if the current number is odd. If the number is odd, output the number to the console with a message indicating that it is odd. Even numbers should not be outputted or mentioned.

**Objective:**

This exercise aims to reinforce understanding of control flow in JavaScript, focusing on using a while loop combined with conditional statements to process and output odd numbers within a given range.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
-9 is odd
-7 is odd
...
7 is odd
9 is odd

```

**Instructions:**

1. Create a while loop that starts with -10 and ends with 10.
2. Use a conditional statement inside the loop to check if the number is odd.
3. If the number is odd, use console.log() to print the number and "is odd" to the console.
4. Ensure that even numbers are not printed.
