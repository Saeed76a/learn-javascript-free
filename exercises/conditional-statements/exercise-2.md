# Exercise 2 - Sort Four Numbers

**Task Description:**

Write a JavaScript function that sorts four given numbers in ascending order. The numbers to sort are 7, -5, 0, and 9. After sorting these numbers, display the sorted list in the console using `console.log`, formatted as a comma-separated sequence.

**Objective:**

This task aims to enhance your understanding of conditional statements and array operations in JavaScript, focusing on manually sorting a small set of numbers.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
-5, 0, 7, 9
```

**Instructions:**

- Define variables for each of the given numbers.
- Implement a sorting mechanism using conditional statements to compare and arrange the numbers in ascending order.
- Use the console.log() function to display the sorted numbers as a comma-separated string in the format shown in the example output.
