**Task Description:**

Write a JavaScript program that defines four variables with the values -11, 3, 0, and -17. Your task is to write a series of conditional statements to find the largest of these four numbers and then display the result in the console using `console.log`, with a message indicating the largest number.

**Objective:**

The goal of this exercise is to practice using conditional statements in JavaScript to compare numeric values and determine the largest among them.

**Example Output:**

```plaintext
The largest number is 3.
```

**Instructions:**

1. Define four variables to store the given numbers.
2. Use conditional statements (if, else if, else) to compare the numbers and find the largest one.
3. Display the largest number using the console.log() function with a message formatted like the example output.
