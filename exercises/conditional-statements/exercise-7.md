# Exercise 7 - Complex Ternary Logic Puzzle

**Task Description:**

Given an array containing a mix of numbers and strings, write a line of JavaScript code using only a ternary operator (no functions or loops) to perform the following checks and actions on the first element of the array:

1. If the first element is a number:

   - Check if it is greater than 50. If so, log "High" to the console; otherwise, log "Low".
   - Additionally, check if it is even or odd, and log "Even" or "Odd" respectively.

2. If the first element is a string:
   - Check if the string length is greater than 5. If so, log "Long" to the console; otherwise, log "Short".
   - Also, check if the string contains the letter "a". If so, log "Contains 'a'" to the console; otherwise, log "No 'a'".

The code should log two separate messages based on the conditions met.

**Objective:**

Challenge your understanding and application of ternary operators to implement complex logic in a single line of code.

**Example Input:**

- `[68, "example", "test"]`
- `["apple", 24, "world"]`

**Example Output:**

For the first array:

- "High"
- "Even"

For the second array:

- "Long"
- "Contains 'a'"

**Instructions:**

- Define an array with a mix of numbers and strings as the first element.
- Use a nested ternary operator to check the conditions and perform the actions described.
- Log the outcomes to the console as separate messages.

**Note:**

Remember, the challenge is to use only a ternary operator for this task, which might involve complex and nested conditions.
