# Exercise 5 - Calculate Factorial

**Task Description**

Write a JavaScript function named `calculateFactorial` that computes the factorial of a given number `n`. The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number.

**Objective**

The goal of this exercise is to reinforce your understanding of loops or recursion in JavaScript by solving a classic mathematical problem.

**Requirements**

- The function should accept a numerical input `n` and return the factorial of `n`.
- Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as negative inputs or `0`, appropriately.

**Example Usage**

```javascript
console.log(calculateFactorial(5)); // Expected Output: 120
console.log(calculateFactorial(0)); // Expected Output: 1 (by definition, the factorial of 0 is 1)
```

**Instructions**

- Consider the mathematical definition of factorial and how it can be implemented in a programming context.
- You may choose to approach this problem iteratively (with loops) or recursively. Think about how each approach would work and what the base case might be for recursion.
- Pay attention to the handling of special cases, such as the factorial of `0`.
