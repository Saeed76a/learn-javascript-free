# Exercise 8 - String Repeater

**Task Description**

Create a JavaScript function named `repeatString` that repeats a given string a specified number of times.

**Objective**

This exercise aims to strengthen your understanding of string manipulation and loops in JavaScript.

**Requirements**

- The function should accept two parameters: a string to repeat and the number of times it should be repeated.
- The function should return the repeated string.

**Example Usage**

```javascript
console.log(repeatString("hello", 3)); // Expected Output: "hellohellohello"
console.log(repeatString("abc", 2)); // Expected Output: "abcabc"
```

**Instructions**

- Ensure your function handles cases where the number of repetitions is zero or negative appropriately.
- Consider using a loop to concatenate the string the specified number of times.

**Hints**

- Start by initializing an empty string to hold the result.
- Use a loop to append the string to the result for the number of times specified.
